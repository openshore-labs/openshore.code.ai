# PROGRESS

The recent-state source of truth for OS Code, kept in the same spirit as the
Uki app repo: current state first, then what remains, then the log.

## Current state (2026-08-18)

**All planned layers are built, tested, polished, and green.** `pnpm install
&& pnpm build` compiles clean; `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint --max-warnings 0`,
and the test suite (11 files, 97 tests) all pass. The CLI runs end to end:
`osc doctor` renders the full health report on a bare machine, and the
complete task path (read, web search, edit with approval and diff, run a
command, commit) passes against the mock provider in `test/endToEnd.test.ts`.
Proven live over real HTTP against a scripted Ollama-protocol server: `osc
run` streams and exits clean, and the daemon serves token-authed sessions with
full SSE replay. On a machine with Ollama, the same path runs against a real
local model with `osc init` then `osc`.

Layer status:

- **Core (agent loop, tools, web, edit engine, local provider, TUI):** built
  and tested. Streaming Ink TUI with static-scrollback transcript, status
  line, approval prompts with diffs, citations panel, slash commands, and a
  considered `--plain` fallback.
- **Security:** enforced, not deferred. Jail, redaction, egress policy,
  daemon bearer auth with a hard no-`0.0.0.0` bind rule, default-deny shell,
  stricter phone/headless profiles, and guardrails that actually halt.
- **Breadth:** router/stack with graceful degradation, cloud escalation with
  confirm-before-spend, RAG (embedding index + keyword fallback) and code
  map, marketplace catalog with hardware fit ratings and preset stacks,
  daemon + reattach + pairing wizard, vision ingest inbox.
- **Polish (delight pass):** streaming smoother (bursty local token streams
  read as calm typing, `tui/smoothing.ts`); a model-load ticker that names
  GPU warmup time instead of a silent hang (`statusLine.busyNote`);
  syntax-tinted diffs at the approval moment (warm strings, teal keywords, dim
  comments, `tui/syntax.ts` + `DiffLine`); a blinking input cursor and a
  pressed-state flash on approval keys; a real byte-level download progress bar
  driven by the Ollama `/api/pull` stream (with a CLI fallback); a low-color
  terminal fallback that downsamples truecolor to xterm-256 or ANSI-16 by
  detected depth (`theme.colorDepth`/`fgSequence`); and a `/find` transcript
  search in both the TUI and plain renderers. All covered by
  `test/polish.test.ts`.

## What remains (known follow-ups, none blocking)

- [ ] **Live-fire pass on a machine with Ollama + a GPU.** Everything is
      wired and covered by tests against the mock and mocked HTTP; the first
      session against real weights should confirm streaming feel and the
      capability probe on all four backends (Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp,
      vLLM).
- [ ] **ComfyUI image path** needs a bundled txt2img workflow graph (A1111
      and OpenAI-images endpoints work today).
- [ ] **Tree-sitter code map** behind the existing `extractSymbols` seam,
      when install-weight is worth it.
- [ ] **Hosted license-verify endpoint** (documented stub; client is real).
- [x] **A11y pass over TUI colors** for low-color terminals: done. Ink
      downsamples on its own; the hand-rolled ANSI surfaces now do too, by
      detected color depth.
- [x] **In-TUI transcript search:** done via `/find` (TUI and plain). A custom
      mouse-free scrollback pager was deliberately NOT built: over SSH the
      terminal's own scrollback already pages, and a custom pager fights it;
      `/find` is the genuinely additive capability.

## Log

- **2026-08-18: delight polish pass.** Streaming smoother, model-load ticker,
  syntax-tinted diffs, cursor blink, approval pressed-state, real download
  progress bar (Ollama `/api/pull`), low-color terminal fallback, and `/find`
  transcript search. New pure modules (`tui/smoothing.ts`, `tui/syntax.ts`,
  `tui/transcriptSearch.ts`) and 16 new tests. Suite: 97 passing.
- **2026-08-18: initial complete build.** Repo scaffolded from empty to a
  working product in three commits (core foundation; breadth layer; TUI,
  commands, tests, docs). Toolchain: Node 20+, TypeScript 5.9 strict ESM,
  Ink 5 + React 18, zod 4, vitest 4, eslint 8 + prettier. See DECISIONS.md
  for every judgment call.
